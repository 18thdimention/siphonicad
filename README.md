### TODOS
- [x] Visible hydraulic data on website
- [x] Export with CSV file
- [x] Implemented equations on website
- [x] Fix algorithms
  - [x] when tee is added, another list should be created starting with tee_side
  - [x] for y-valves, there should be a elbow90 and an elbow45 (elbow90 should be on the side with the larger capacity)
- [x] Delete Feature
- [x] automatic tee
- [x] q90, f, kred is 0 if 1, k_total is incorrect, k_red for discharge
- [ ] drag and copy and paste functionality
- [ ] vertical? capacity? length?
- [ ] tee to y-valve
- [ ] while drawing up moving
- [ ] node selection change, outlet capacity change at once
- [ ] 3D blueprint instead of quantity
- [ ] reducer next to pipe (flowing down)
- [ ] y 관 표시 방법
- [ ] highlight only the pipes red. Don't color the rest

### BUGS PATCHES
- [x] when starting drawing again, double pipe is added and the numbering is incorrect
